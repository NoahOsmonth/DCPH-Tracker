/**
 * Plan execution: the ladder and the deterministic tools in one round trip,
 * merged into one ranked evidence set.
 *
 * Four properties the pipeline above this stage depends on:
 *
 * 1. **One round trip.** The ladder and `runTools` are started before either is
 *    awaited, so the gather costs the slower branch, not their sum. The phase's
 *    latency budget assumes this; a sequential executor is a regression.
 * 2. **The ladder subsumes three of the plan's eight tools.** `search_catalog`,
 *    `search_cases` and `wiki_lookup` are the ladder's own branches scoped to one
 *    namespace, so dispatching them too would fetch the same documents twice and
 *    pay twice for it. They are dropped, and the drop is recorded in `dropped`.
 * 3. **The merge is a total order** (rrf desc, score desc, id asc), because the
 *    assembler numbers the evidence and `[E3]` has to mean the same document on
 *    a retry.
 * 4. **The stage is bounded and cannot throw.** An expiring budget returns what
 *    has arrived; a gather that breaks outright is a flag in the report. A throw
 *    here is a 500 on a question the other gather could still answer.
 *
 * Everything is injected: the source, the wiki lookup, the tool context and the
 * clock. Importing this module performs no I/O.
