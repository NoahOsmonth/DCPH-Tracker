/**
 * The one seam between the chat route and everything the transcript feature
 * stores.
 *
 * The route must not know PostgREST, and it must not be modified every time the
 * schema moves. So this module builds the admin client, the two adapters and the
 * two stores, and hands the route a facade of five calls and one id — which also
 * means one line in a route test neutralises persistence completely (rule 7: the
 * existing integration test mocks this module, not the database).
 *
 * Three rules shape the facade. It is *best effort*: `createRequestPersistence`
 * rejects when the store cannot resolve a conversation, and the caller decides
 * to fall back to the client's history — a conversation problem may never cost
 * an answer (constraint 14). It owns the `AI_MEMORY` switch, read once so a
 * request's read and write agree about which mode it is in (D6: unset or any
 * value other than "off" means on). And nothing it does after the response may
 * reject: `after()` has no error boundary of its own, so `afterTurn` contains
 * every failure as a `[ai-chat]` line and a resolved promise.
 *
 * No I/O of its own beyond what the injected clock and the adapters do, so a
 * test drives every branch with a scripted admin client and never constructs a
 * real Supabase client (constraint 10).
